# Welcome to MobiMouse ðŸ‘‹

This app is about creating a mobile phone which is capable of controlling desktop cursor.
Also this is my college project but it will be open source so anyone can use it for their work.
Any help will appreciated as I do intend to work on this project even after my college.  

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm install axios
   npm install express
   npm install robotjs
   npm install cors
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
3. Run the server.js script

   ```bash
      node scripts/server.js
   ```
